Great design.  It's clean AND responsive!

Good use of multiple tags in your media query to reduce potentially redundant code.

Indentation of code is almost perfect and very readable  Make sure you are properly indenting your CSS code as well - you missed some.

Good naming conventions in your js file.  HTML class names are pretty good.  Lets try to avoid using generic and potentially confusing names in the future.
For example 'parent' should be something like 'parent-of-inputs' and 'container' should be 'container-for-result'.

Thank you for using class's and id's to manipulate the CSS rather than using the tags.
